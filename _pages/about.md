I'm a junior at Harvard studying math & stat. My research interests lie in learning theory, especially **universality phenomena** in high-dimensional inference and learning algorithms such as approximate message passing (AMP). I'm privileged to be advised by [Prof. Yue Lu](https://lu.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Prof. Subhabrata Sen](https://sites.harvard.edu/sus977/).<br>

If you're also interested in anything _stochastic_, please reach out at nthuc0406[at]gmail[dot]com I'd love to chat!
