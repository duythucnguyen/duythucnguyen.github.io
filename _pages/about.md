I'm a junior studying math & statistics at Harvard with strong interests in learning theory. My current research focuses on **universality phenomena** of learning and inference tools, such as approximate message passing (AMP), in the high-dimensional setting. I'm privileged to be advised by [Prof. Yue Lu](https://lu.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Prof. Subhabrata Sen](https://sites.harvard.edu/sus977/). 

If you're also interested in anything _stochastic_, please reach out at nthuc0406[at]gmail[dot]com I'd love to chat!
