I enjoy reading about math and philosophy. Here are a few books I'd highly recommend!
## Math
- *High-Dimensional Probability* — Vershynin
- *Measure, Integration & Real Analysis* — Axler

## Philosophy
- *Reality: A Synthesis of Thomistic Thoughts* — Garrigou-Lagrange
- *A Brief Refutation of Middle Knowledge* — Charles-René Billuart
