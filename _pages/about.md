I'm a junior studying math & statistics at Harvard with strong interests in learning theory. My current research focuses on universality phenomena of learning algorithms, such as approximate message passing (AMP). I'm privileged to be advised by [Prof. Yue Lu](https://lu.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Prof. Subhabrata Sen](https://sites.harvard.edu/sus977/). 

If you're also interested in anything _stochastic_, please reach out at nthuc0406[at]gmail[dot]com I'd love to chat!
